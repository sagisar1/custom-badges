# custom-badges
Custom badges of different pentesting tools

the repository contains custom badges I created for my personal use,  
and contain a python script to allow anyone who wants to create custom badges similar to shields.io functioning, but as a self contained svg file,  
and without any restrictions on the svg logo file size.

enjoy :)
